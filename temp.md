```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

The original code had a few issues:

1. **Missing Parameters:** The `sum` function was defined without any input parameters (a and b), but it was trying to
use variables `a` and `b` inside the function body. This would lead to errors or unexpected behavior because `a` and `b`
would be interpreted as global variables (or would be undefined).
2. **No explicit return type:** While JavaScript doesn't enforce return types, it's good practice to make sure your
function returns something.
3. **No Indentation:** Correctly indenting makes the code readable.

The corrected code addresses these issues:

* **Parameters Added:** The function definition now includes `(a, b)` which defines `a` and `b` as parameters that the
function expects to receive as input.
* **Returns the sum:** The function calculates the sum of the two parameters.
* **Indentation:** The code is properly indented for readability.
